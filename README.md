# Futexes

## About

The **f**ast **u**serspace mu**tex** mechanism was proposed by Linux contributors in 2002 and you
can find it in the implementation of several synchronization primitives in Linux.
A great introduction is [Basics of Futexes](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/basics-of-futexes)
from where I borrow the first examples.
This repository consists of several demos to learn more about this particular syscall.

## Getting Started

To build a particular example use
```sh
make <example_name>
```
or just
```sh
make all
```
to compile all of them.
